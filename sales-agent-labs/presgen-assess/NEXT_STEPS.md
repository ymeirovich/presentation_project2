# PresGen-Assess: Next Steps Summary

## Current Status: Phase 3 Complete ✅

**Achievement**: Fully functional REST API with enterprise-grade security and comprehensive documentation

**What's Ready:**
- 25+ production-ready API endpoints
- JWT authentication with role-based permissions
- Complete OpenAPI/Swagger documentation
- Integration testing validated
- Git repository updated with all changes

## Immediate Next Steps

### 1. Phase 4 Implementation Focus

- Integrate PresGen-Assess interfaces into the shared Next.js application at `sales-agent-labs/presgen-ui`.
- Follow [`UI_IMPLEMENTATION.md`](UI_IMPLEMENTATION.md) milestones covering navigation, assessment forms, workflow dashboards, and gap analysis views.
- Align delivery timeline with PresGen UI maintainers, design, and QA checkpoints.

### 2. Technology Alignment

- Leverage existing stack: Next.js 14, TypeScript, Tailwind, shadcn/ui, react-hook-form, zod.
- Evaluate Recharts or Nivo for domain/Bloom visualizations once design approves.
- Configure `NEXT_PUBLIC_ASSESS_API_URL` and credentials per `presgen-ui/DEPLOYMENT_GUIDE.md`.
- Infrastructure reminder: hosting, API server (uvicorn), PostgreSQL, and ChromaDB all run locally today; no cloud deployment is in place until launch preparations begin.

### 3. Quick Wins (Can Start Today)

- Draft wireframes for assessment form, workflow timeline, and gap dashboards.
- Add skeleton `assess-api` client module plus unit tests in `presgen-ui` to mirror backend contracts.
- Prepare backend mock fixtures enabling frontend parallel development.

**Wireframe references:** See `UI_IMPLEMENTATION.md` for ASCII drafts covering assessment intake, workflow timeline, and gap dashboard layouts.

## Development Environment Setup

### Backend (Already Complete)
```bash
# Start the API server
uvicorn src.service.app:app --host 0.0.0.0 --port 8080 --reload

# Available at:
# API: http://localhost:8080
# Docs: http://localhost:8080/docs
# Health: http://localhost:8080/health
```

### Frontend (Next Phase)
```bash
# Inside sales-agent-labs/presgen-ui
npm install            # ensure dependencies are current

# Start development server
npm run dev

# Optional additions (after design sign-off)
npm install recharts             # or @nivo packages for gap visualizations
npm install @tanstack/react-query
```

## Priority Features for Phase 4

### Week 1: Navigation & Assessment Form
- [x] Add PresGen-Assess tab/route within presgen-ui
- [x] Implement assessment request form with validation + markdown preview
- [x] Connect form submission to staging API (mock fallback if offline)

### Week 2: Workflow Dashboard
- [ ] Build 11-step workflow timeline with status polling + retry actions
- [ ] Create workflow list filters/search + detail panels
- [ ] Add component/unit tests covering success/error states

### Week 3: Gap Analysis & Assets
- [ ] Render domain/Bloom charts and remediation asset tables
- [ ] Provide export/download actions (CSV/Markdown/Google links)
- [ ] Write integration tests covering submission → analysis display

### Week 4: Hardening & Launch Prep
- [ ] Complete accessibility, bias, and performance reviews per constitution
- [ ] Validate observability dashboards + alert thresholds
- [ ] Update docs/runbooks and run pilot walkthrough

## Success Criteria

**Phase 4 Complete When:**
- ✅ Users can authenticate and access personalized dashboard
- ✅ Complete assessment taking experience (start to finish)
- ✅ Gap analysis results displayed with visualizations
- ✅ Presentation generation and viewing functionality
- ✅ Mobile-responsive design
- ✅ Comprehensive testing and documentation

## Resource Requirements

### Development
- **Frontend Developer**: React/TypeScript expertise
- **UI/UX Designer**: User interface design and user experience
- **Full-Stack Developer**: Backend integration and API optimization

### Infrastructure
- **Hosting**: Frontend hosting (Vercel, Netlify, AWS S3/CloudFront)
- **API Server**: Backend hosting (AWS EC2, GCP, Digital Ocean)
- **Database**: PostgreSQL hosting (AWS RDS, Google Cloud SQL)
- **CDN**: Static asset delivery

### Timeline
- **Phase 4 Frontend**: 4-6 weeks
- **Testing and Deployment**: 1-2 weeks
- **Documentation and Training**: 1 week

## Decision Points

### Choose Development Path:
1. **Full Frontend Development** → Complete user experience
2. **API Enhancement** → Advanced backend features
3. **Production Deployment** → Infrastructure and scaling
4. **Integration Focus** → Connect with existing systems

### Technology Decisions:
1. **UI Framework**: Material-UI vs Tailwind CSS vs Chakra UI
2. **State Management**: React Query + Context vs Redux Toolkit
3. **Deployment**: Static hosting vs full-stack hosting
4. **Testing**: Jest + RTL vs Vitest + Testing Library

---

**Recommendation**: Start with Phase 4 Frontend Development using React + TypeScript to provide complete user experience and maximize the value of the robust API foundation built in Phases 1-3.

**Ready to Begin**: All prerequisites complete, API documented and tested, clear implementation plan available.
