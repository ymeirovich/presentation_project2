# Phase 4 Project Status ‚Äì PresGen-Core Integration

_Last updated: 2025-09-27_

## Current Status
- ‚úÖ PresGen-Assess server now boots successfully with uvicorn (port 8081) after fixing the missing `get_enhanced_logger` import by adding the helper to `src/common/enhanced_logging.py`.
- ‚úÖ `/api/v1/google-forms/create` endpoint verified end-to-end; live form created via OAuth (`token_forms.json`).
- üü° `configure_form_settings` currently no-ops for invalid Google payload fields (TODO to map to supported schema).
- üü° Workflow orchestrator still placeholder; job queue, circuit breaker, and PresGen API integration not yet implemented.

## Recent Changes
1. Added `get_enhanced_logger` helper to `src/common/enhanced_logging.py`, resolving the import error raised by `response_ingestion_service` and allowing uvicorn startup.
2. Simplified Google Forms service to use batch updates compliant with the API, enabling smoke-test curls to succeed with live Google credentials.

## Blockers & Next Steps
- Replace no-op settings stub with valid Google Forms update requests once schema mapping is defined.
- Implement Phase 4 Sprint 1 tasks: enhanced PresGen client, job queue, monitoring stack, and basic PresGen API integration.
- Wire workflow orchestrator to call PresGen client, update workflow states, and enqueue jobs.
- Fix pytest asyncio fixtures so Phase 2 suites run, preventing regressions while Phase 4 work proceeds.

## Metrics / Monitoring
- Health: Server boot ‚úîÔ∏è
- Tests: `pytest` still failing at async fixture (Phase 2 suite)
- Ops: Structured logging and enhanced logger now available; metrics stack pending Phase 4 Sprint 1 work.

## Owner Notes
- Keep OAuth token refreshed; service account disabled for Forms creation.
- Document new logging helper usage (`get_enhanced_logger`) in coding guidelines.
- Coordinate with Phase 4 Sprint plans to prioritize resilience and monitoring in the upcoming iteration.
