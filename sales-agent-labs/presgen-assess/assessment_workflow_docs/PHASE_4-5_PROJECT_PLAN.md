 📋 COMPREHENSIVE PROJECT PLAN: Assessment → Avatar-Narrated Presentation

 ISSUE SUMMARY
 1. Create a very detailed project plan and task todos for next steps. Think hard and use Sequential-Thinking
  MCP for assistance.\
  2. Improve logging at each stage.\
  3. Create TDD manual testing instructions for each Sprint\
  4. Prioritize todos and organize into Sprints\
  5. Focus on:\
  a. Immediate Recommended Actions\
  b. Immediate Priorities\
  c. Phase 5, BUT focus on Presentation-only presentations. Video-only and Video-Presentation presentations set
  for upgrades\
  \
  Goal is to get to working e2e assessment -> avatar-narrated presentation.\
  6. Review workflow and prioritize in the project plan:\
  a. Assessment request -> Workflow Timeline runs automatically to generate a Google Form using the
  Certification Profile Assessment Prompt + Uploaded Resources (exam guide, transcript, additional resources) to
  generate the Form questions. Map each question to a skill found in the exam guide. No Mock Questions or based SOLELY on LLM knowledge. One Learner => One Certification Profile => One Google Form => One associate Google Sheet \
  b. Google Form Completion -> Workflow Timeline polls for completed Form responses, BUT has manual trigger to
  retrieve response. \
  c. Gap Analysis Dashboard:\
  1) Back button NOT displaying even though code says it's implemented -> '/Users/yitzchak/Desktop/Screenshot
  2025-09-28 at 11.00.19.png'\
  2) What will Gap Analysis Dashboard display and how will it help the learner?\
  3) What are the next stages in the workflow?\
  d. Google Sheets output:\
  1) Answer sheet: Correct / Incorrect answers\
  2) Gap Analysis sheet: Results from Gap Analysis engine processing. Use Certification Profile Gap Analysis
  prompt. Shows what the learner knows, doesn’t know, recommended learning path, charts illustrating knowledge and skills gaps. Gap Analysis maps incorrect assessment answers to exam guide skills. Categorize the analysis according to the exam guide.
3) Outline sheet: Shows detailed sentence-outline of content that maps to each skills gap. Content is derived from the transcript and additional resources. 
4) Presentation sheet: Using the certification profile presentation prompt, generate a list of linked avatar-narrated presentations stored on Google Drive in a custom folder with the name of the certification profile. Integrate with Presgen-core, generate and upload the required Presgen-core prompts and content files for the presentation. Then, integrate with Presgen-Avatar (formerly Presgen-Training) to generate a Presentation-only presentation. Use default values. Return links to the Presentation sheet.

  🎯 EXECUTIVE SUMMARY

  Goal: End-to-end workflow from assessment request to avatar-narrated presentationTimeline: 4 Sprints (8-10
  weeks)Focus: Presentation-only (video upgrades future)Architecture: Build on existing Phase 4 Sprint 4
