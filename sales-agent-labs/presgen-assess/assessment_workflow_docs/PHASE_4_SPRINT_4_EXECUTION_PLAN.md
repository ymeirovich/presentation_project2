## Technical Analysis: Current vs Target

### **Current Implementation** (Sprint 3)
```python
# Basic sample questions in trigger orchestration
assessment_data = {
    "questions": [
        {
            "id": f"q{i+1}",
            "question_text": f"Sample question {i+1} for {workflow.parameters.get('title')}",
            "question_type": "multiple_choice",
            "options": ["A) Option 1", "B) Option 2", "C) Option 3", "D) Option 4"],
            "correct_answer": "A"
        } for i in range(5)
    ]
}
```

### **Target Implementation** (Sprint 4)
```python
# AI-powered question generation with knowledge base
assessment_data = await self.question_generator.generate_contextual_assessment(
    certification_profile=workflow.certification_profile_id,
    user_profile=workflow.user_id,
    difficulty_level=workflow.parameters.get('difficulty_level', 'intermediate'),
    domain_distribution=workflow.parameters.get('domain_distribution', {}),
    question_count=workflow.parameters.get('question_count', 24)
