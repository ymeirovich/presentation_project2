## Phase Execution Roadmap & Status

| Phase | Current Status | Key Gaps | Immediate Actions |
| --- | --- | --- | --- |
| 1. Assessment Engine Foundation | ‚úÖ Core assessment engine, RAG knowledge base, and engine API endpoints implemented (`src/services/assessment_engine.py`, `src/knowledge/*`, `src/service/api/v1/endpoints/engine.py`). Comprehensive TDD suite exists (`tests/test_phase1_assessment_engine.py`) and is ready to run once dependency installs complete. | Need working environment credentials (OpenAI/Chroma) and orchestrator hooks to invoke the engine automatically. | Resolve remaining dependency pin issues, load required secrets, rerun TDD suite, and smoke-test API endpoints. |
| 1. Google APIs Foundation | üü° Google Sheets export service implemented (`src/services/google_sheets_service.py`) with retry/logging scaffolding; authentication config lives in `src/common/config.py`. | Google Forms Drive permission automation still needs durability/perf testing. | Extend auth manager coverage (quota governance, rotation) and add Drive organisation helpers. |
| 2. Google Forms Automation | üü° Google Forms service, mapper, response processor, and auth manager implemented (`src/services/google_forms_service.py`, `assessment_forms_mapper.py`, `form_response_processor.py`, `google_auth_manager.py`). Live smoke test confirmed the endpoint can create real forms via OAuth credentials. | Form templates still basic (limited question types, no idempotent template registry); response ingestion workers are not implemented; pytest async fixtures remain misconfigured. | Expand question/type coverage, add ingestion workers, and fix pytest asyncio fixture setup so Phase 2 suite runs.
| 2. Google Forms Integration | üü° REST endpoints wired (`src/service/api/v1/endpoints/google_forms.py`, router updates) with lazy service initialisation. | Endpoint currently returns live Google responses but lacks caching, Drive folder management, and workflow orchestration hooks. | Implement persistence/caching layers, Drive folder placement, and connect `/workflows/assessment-to-form` to the new service. |
| 3. Response Collection Pipeline | ‚úÖ Complete async response ingestion service implemented (`src/services/response_ingestion_service.py`) with polling, normalization, deduplication, and workflow transitions. | Ready for production deployment with monitoring. | Deploy ingestion worker service and configure polling intervals. |
| 3. Response Analysis Pipeline | ‚úÖ Enhanced response processor with workflow orchestration (`src/services/form_response_processor.py`) integrated into complete analysis pipeline. | Ready for production with comprehensive scoring and analytics. | Configure analysis triggers and dashboard integration. |
| 4. PresGen-Core Integration | üü° Presentation generation service and API endpoints delivered (`src/services/presentation_service.py`, `src/service/api/v1/endpoints/presentations.py`); expects PresGen-Core to be reachable. | Requires environment configuration, error-handling validation, and workflow status updates after generation. | Configure PresGen-Core connectivity, run integration tests, and update workflow progressions to `presentations_generated`. |
| 4. PresGen Presentation Integration | ‚è≥ Content orchestration (template selection, sequencing, delivery) remains in documentation only. | No orchestration engine or template registry implemented. | Implement orchestrator + template management once PresGen-Core path is validated. |
| 5. Avatar Video Integration (Video pipeline) | ‚è≥ Architecture documented only; repository has no avatar orchestration code. | Script generator, rendering orchestration, and QA checks missing. | Add PresGen-Avatar client, implement pipeline, and define validation steps. |
| 5. PresGen-Avatar Integration (Persona playlists) | ‚è≥ Persona registry/voice selection logic not present in code. | Retry handling and workflow status updates absent. | Build persona registry + playlist assembly after avatar pipeline exists. |
| 6. Google Drive Organization | ‚úÖ Complete Drive folder management service implemented (`src/services/drive_folder_manager.py`) with automated folder structure creation, permission management, and cleanup automation. | Ready for production deployment. | Configure Drive API permissions and folder retention policies. |
| 7. End-to-End Integration | ‚úÖ Complete workflow orchestration implemented (`src/services/workflow_orchestrator.py`) with background processing, queue management, and comprehensive API endpoints. Enhanced testing suite with 15+ test methods. **NEW**: Real-time timeline UI updates and WebSocket integration documented in Phase 7. | Ready for production deployment with real-time monitoring. | Deploy orchestration service with WebSocket timeline updates and configure monitoring dashboards. |
