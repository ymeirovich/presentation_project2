# Assessment Workflow Status

_Last updated: 2025-09-27_

## Latest Execution Attempt
- Normalised the Python environment: updated `requirements.txt` (e.g., `pypdf==3.16.2`, `sqlalchemy==2.0.36`, `pytest-asyncio==0.20.3`, `google-api-python-client==2.183.0`) and reinstalled dependencies without build failures.
- Implemented OAuth-based authentication for Google Forms (`GOOGLE_USER_TOKEN_PATH` + dynamic refresh in `GoogleAuthManager`), enabling real API calls from local development.
- Exercised the `/api/v1/google-forms/create` endpoint end-to-end via curl; Google returned a live form ID/URL confirming that dynamic form creation works against the real API.
- Updated `GoogleFormsService` to respect API constraints (title-only creation, follow-up batch updates) and stubbed out unsupported settings to avoid 4xx payload errors.
- Ran `./venv/bin/python -m pytest --maxfail=1 --disable-warnings -q`; execution still fails at `tests/test_phase2_google_forms.py::TestGoogleFormsService::test_create_assessment_form` because the async fixture is not initialised correctly (pytest treats it as a coroutine). Downstream suites remain unexecuted until the fixture setup is fixed.

## Phase Execution Roadmap & Status

| Phase | Current Status | Key Gaps | Immediate Actions |
| --- | --- | --- | --- |
| 1. Assessment Engine Foundation | ‚úÖ Core assessment engine, RAG knowledge base, and engine API endpoints implemented (`src/services/assessment_engine.py`, `src/knowledge/*`, `src/service/api/v1/endpoints/engine.py`). Comprehensive TDD suite exists (`tests/test_phase1_assessment_engine.py`) and is ready to run once dependency installs complete. | Need working environment credentials (OpenAI/Chroma) and orchestrator hooks to invoke the engine automatically. | Resolve remaining dependency pin issues, load required secrets, rerun TDD suite, and smoke-test API endpoints. |
| 1. Google APIs Foundation | üü° Google Sheets export service implemented (`src/services/google_sheets_service.py`) with retry/logging scaffolding; authentication config lives in `src/common/config.py`. | Google Forms Drive permission automation still needs durability/perf testing. | Extend auth manager coverage (quota governance, rotation) and add Drive organisation helpers. |
| 2. Google Forms Automation | üü° Google Forms service, mapper, response processor, and auth manager implemented (`src/services/google_forms_service.py`, `assessment_forms_mapper.py`, `form_response_processor.py`, `google_auth_manager.py`). Live smoke test confirmed the endpoint can create real forms via OAuth credentials. | Form templates still basic (limited question types, no idempotent template registry); response ingestion workers are not implemented; pytest async fixtures remain misconfigured. | Expand question/type coverage, add ingestion workers, and fix pytest asyncio fixture setup so Phase 2 suite runs.
| 2. Google Forms Integration | üü° REST endpoints wired (`src/service/api/v1/endpoints/google_forms.py`, router updates) with lazy service initialisation. | Endpoint currently returns live Google responses but lacks caching, Drive folder management, and workflow orchestration hooks. | Implement persistence/caching layers, Drive folder placement, and connect `/workflows/assessment-to-form` to the new service. |
| 3. Response Collection Pipeline | ‚è≥ Workflow models allow storing responses, but schedulers/pollers are not implemented. | No ingestion worker, normalization logic, or quality alerts yet. | Design async ingestion job, persist normalized responses, and connect status transitions. |
| 3. Response Analysis Pipeline | üü° Gap analysis engine implemented (`src/services/gap_analysis.py`) with structured exports and logging; new `FormResponseProcessor` handles scoring/analytics for Forms responses. | Need persistence of analysis artifacts and automated orchestration from response ingestion. | Wire analysis engine into workflow orchestration, persist `gap_analysis_results`, and expose analytics dashboards. |
| 4. PresGen-Core Integration | üü° Presentation generation service and API endpoints delivered (`src/services/presentation_service.py`, `src/service/api/v1/endpoints/presentations.py`); expects PresGen-Core to be reachable. | Requires environment configuration, error-handling validation, and workflow status updates after generation. | Configure PresGen-Core connectivity, run integration tests, and update workflow progressions to `presentations_generated`. |
| 4. PresGen Presentation Integration | ‚è≥ Content orchestration (template selection, sequencing, delivery) remains in documentation only. | No orchestration engine or template registry implemented. | Implement orchestrator + template management once PresGen-Core path is validated. |
| 5. Avatar Video Integration (Video pipeline) | ‚è≥ Architecture documented only; repository has no avatar orchestration code. | Script generator, rendering orchestration, and QA checks missing. | Add PresGen-Avatar client, implement pipeline, and define validation steps. |
| 5. PresGen-Avatar Integration (Persona playlists) | ‚è≥ Persona registry/voice selection logic not present in code. | Retry handling and workflow status updates absent. | Build persona registry + playlist assembly after avatar pipeline exists. |
| 6. Google Drive Organization | ‚è≥ Retention/folder structure documented; automation not yet implemented. | Folder provisioning, tagging, and retention jobs missing. | Implement Drive automation services and permission audits. |
| 7. End-to-End Integration | üü° Workflow CRUD endpoints and persistence models implemented (`src/service/api/v1/endpoints/workflows.py`, `src/models/workflow.py`); placeholder `/assessment-to-form` endpoint responds but orchestration not wired. | Missing queue-backed orchestrator/background processors, metrics, and holistic tests. | Stand up orchestrator/queue, emit metrics, and add validation/monitoring dashboards. |

## Testing Status
- Command: `./venv/bin/python -m pytest --maxfail=1 --disable-warnings -q`
- Result: **Failed during test execution** ‚Äì `AttributeError: 'coroutine' object has no attribute 'create_assessment_form'` from `tests/test_phase2_google_forms.py::TestGoogleFormsService::test_create_assessment_form`
  - Action: align pytest asyncio configuration so async fixtures resolve to instances (or refactor fixtures to use `pytest_asyncio.fixture`) before rerunning the suite; once fixtures initialise correctly, continue hardening the Google Forms service functionality.
  - Note: Full-suite runs time out after the same fixture error repeats; no downstream tests have executed yet.

## Logging & Observability Checklist
- ‚úÖ Workflow creation/detail logging via `presgen_assess.workflows` and per-service rotating file handlers (`src/common/logging_config.py`).
- ‚úÖ Correlation ID + structured logging utilities available (`src/common/enhanced_logging.py`).
- ‚¨ú Stage-by-stage logging for assessment/gap/presentation/video pipelines (awaits orchestrator wiring).
- ‚¨ú Metrics/alerts per phase (planned; not yet instrumented).
- ‚¨ú Workflow timeline aggregation/dashboarding (Phase 7 deliverable).
