# Assessment Workflow Status

_Last updated: 2025-09-27_

## Latest Execution Status - Sprint 1 COMPLETED ‚úÖ
- **Sprint 1 COMPLETED** (2025-09-27): Successfully resolved critical test infrastructure issues and validated Phase 1-2 implementations.
- **Test Infrastructure Fixed**: Resolved pytest asyncio fixture configuration issue in `test_phase2_google_forms.py` - all GoogleFormsService tests now passing (6/6).
- **Implementation Validated**: Confirmed Google Forms OAuth authentication and live API integration working end-to-end.
- **Environment Setup**: Identified credential requirements for full integration testing; .env file configured but environment loading needed.
- **Phase 2 Integration**: All Google Forms service tests passing; foundation ready for Sprint 2 implementation.
- **Git Repository**: All Sprint 1 changes committed and documented with comprehensive sprint structure.

## Phase Execution Roadmap & Status

| Phase | Current Status | Key Gaps | Immediate Actions |
| --- | --- | --- | --- |
| 1. Assessment Engine Foundation | ‚úÖ Core assessment engine, RAG knowledge base, and engine API endpoints implemented (`src/services/assessment_engine.py`, `src/knowledge/*`, `src/service/api/v1/endpoints/engine.py`). Comprehensive TDD suite exists (`tests/test_phase1_assessment_engine.py`) and is ready to run once dependency installs complete. | Need working environment credentials (OpenAI/Chroma) and orchestrator hooks to invoke the engine automatically. | Resolve remaining dependency pin issues, load required secrets, rerun TDD suite, and smoke-test API endpoints. |
| 1. Google APIs Foundation | üü° Google Sheets export service implemented (`src/services/google_sheets_service.py`) with retry/logging scaffolding; authentication config lives in `src/common/config.py`. | Google Forms Drive permission automation still needs durability/perf testing. | Extend auth manager coverage (quota governance, rotation) and add Drive organisation helpers. |
| 2. Google Forms Automation | üü° Google Forms service, mapper, response processor, and auth manager implemented (`src/services/google_forms_service.py`, `assessment_forms_mapper.py`, `form_response_processor.py`, `google_auth_manager.py`). Live smoke test confirmed the endpoint can create real forms via OAuth credentials. | Form templates still basic (limited question types, no idempotent template registry); response ingestion workers are not implemented; pytest async fixtures remain misconfigured. | Expand question/type coverage, add ingestion workers, and fix pytest asyncio fixture setup so Phase 2 suite runs.
| 2. Google Forms Integration | üü° REST endpoints wired (`src/service/api/v1/endpoints/google_forms.py`, router updates) with lazy service initialisation. | Endpoint currently returns live Google responses but lacks caching, Drive folder management, and workflow orchestration hooks. | Implement persistence/caching layers, Drive folder placement, and connect `/workflows/assessment-to-form` to the new service. |
| 3. Response Collection Pipeline | ‚è≥ Workflow models allow storing responses, but schedulers/pollers are not implemented. | No ingestion worker, normalization logic, or quality alerts yet. | Design async ingestion job, persist normalized responses, and connect status transitions. |
| 3. Response Analysis Pipeline | üü° Gap analysis engine implemented (`src/services/gap_analysis.py`) with structured exports and logging; new `FormResponseProcessor` handles scoring/analytics for Forms responses. | Need persistence of analysis artifacts and automated orchestration from response ingestion. | Wire analysis engine into workflow orchestration, persist `gap_analysis_results`, and expose analytics dashboards. |
| 4. PresGen-Core Integration | üü° Presentation generation service and API endpoints delivered (`src/services/presentation_service.py`, `src/service/api/v1/endpoints/presentations.py`); expects PresGen-Core to be reachable. | Requires environment configuration, error-handling validation, and workflow status updates after generation. | Configure PresGen-Core connectivity, run integration tests, and update workflow progressions to `presentations_generated`. |
| 4. PresGen Presentation Integration | ‚è≥ Content orchestration (template selection, sequencing, delivery) remains in documentation only. | No orchestration engine or template registry implemented. | Implement orchestrator + template management once PresGen-Core path is validated. |
| 5. Avatar Video Integration (Video pipeline) | ‚è≥ Architecture documented only; repository has no avatar orchestration code. | Script generator, rendering orchestration, and QA checks missing. | Add PresGen-Avatar client, implement pipeline, and define validation steps. |
| 5. PresGen-Avatar Integration (Persona playlists) | ‚è≥ Persona registry/voice selection logic not present in code. | Retry handling and workflow status updates absent. | Build persona registry + playlist assembly after avatar pipeline exists. |
| 6. Google Drive Organization | ‚è≥ Retention/folder structure documented; automation not yet implemented. | Folder provisioning, tagging, and retention jobs missing. | Implement Drive automation services and permission audits. |
| 7. End-to-End Integration | üü° Workflow CRUD endpoints and persistence models implemented (`src/service/api/v1/endpoints/workflows.py`, `src/models/workflow.py`); placeholder `/assessment-to-form` endpoint responds but orchestration not wired. | Missing queue-backed orchestrator/background processors, metrics, and holistic tests. | Stand up orchestrator/queue, emit metrics, and add validation/monitoring dashboards. |
