# Phase 4: PresGen-Core Presentation Integration

## Overview
**Phase 4** integrates with PresGen-Core for AI-powered presentation generation based on assessment results and gap analysis.

## Core Components

### 1. PresGen Integration Service (`src/services/presgen_integration.py`)
```python
class PresGenIntegrationService:
    """Integration with PresGen-Core for presentation generation."""

    async def generate_learning_presentation(self, gap_analysis: Dict) -> Dict:
        """Generate targeted learning presentations."""

    async def create_remediation_content(self, weak_domains: List[str]) -> Dict:
        """Create focused remediation presentations."""
```

### 2. Content Orchestrator (`src/services/content_orchestrator.py`)
```python
class ContentOrchestrator:
    """Orchestrates content generation across systems."""

    async def orchestrate_learning_pipeline(self, assessment_id: str) -> Dict:
        """Complete learning pipeline from assessment to presentation."""
```

## API Endpoints
- `POST /api/v1/presentations/generate` - Generate learning presentations
- `POST /api/v1/content/orchestrate` - Full content orchestration
- `GET /api/v1/presentations/{presentation_id}/status` - Check generation status

## Integration Points
- PresGen-Core API integration
- Slide template management
- Content versioning and tracking

**Phase 4 Status**: ✅ **ARCHITECTURE DEFINED** - Ready for Implementation

## Implementation Roadmap (Detailed)

1. **Presentation Template Management**
   - Curate template catalog (executive, deep dive, remediation) with metadata describing sections, slide limits, and styling.
   - Build API to select template per workflow based on certification and audience.
2. **Content Orchestration Engine**
   - Sequence content pipeline: assessment summary → gap deep dives → remediation plan → call-to-action slides.
   - Support multi-track outputs (overview deck + detailed appendix) using the same data sources.
3. **Asset Delivery**
   - Persist presentation IDs, share links, and version metadata; ensure Drive permissions align with organization policies.
4. **Workflow Integration**
   - Update status transitions and progress as slides generate; allow incremental updates (e.g., regenerate specific sections).
5. **Resilience & Idempotency**
   - Implement deduplication tokens to avoid duplicate deck creation when workflows are retried.

## Test-Driven Development Strategy

1. **Template Selection Tests**
   - TDD logic mapping certification + persona to template choices, ensuring fallback defaults exist.
2. **Content Assembly Tests**
   - Validate orchestrator output structure (slide order, asset references) using synthetic assessment data and snapshot assertions.
3. **API Tests**
   - Mock downstream PresGen endpoints verifying orchestration endpoints manage async tasks and expose status correctly.
4. **Idempotency Tests**
   - Ensure repeated calls with same workflow ID do not create duplicate assets.

## Logging & Observability Enhancements

1. **Timeline Logging**
   - Log each orchestration stage (`assemble_outline`, `render_slide`, `publish`) with workflow/presentation IDs and timings.
2. **Metrics**
   - Track slides generated, time per section, and failure rates per template.
3. **Alerts**
   - Notify when presentations remain in progress beyond SLA or when content validation fails.
4. **Audit Trail**
   - Record which assessment/gap datasets fed each slide deck for compliance and troubleshooting.
