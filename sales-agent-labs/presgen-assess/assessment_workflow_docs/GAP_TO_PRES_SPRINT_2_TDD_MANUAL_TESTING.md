## Test S2-T1: Export Button & API Endpoint

**Feature**: "Export to Sheets" button triggers on-demand sheet creation
**Prerequisites**:
- Sprint 1 complete (gap analysis data in database)
- Feature flag `ENABLE_SHEETS_EXPORT=true`
- Google Sheets API credentials configured

### Test Case 1.1: Export Button Visibility and Click

**Setup**:
```bash
# Set feature flag
export ENABLE_SHEETS_EXPORT=true

# Start server
uvicorn src.service.app:app --port 8081 --reload
```

**Test Steps**:
1. Navigate to Gap Analysis Dashboard:
```
http://localhost:3000/workflows/19952bd09cfe44bc9460c4f521caca89/gap-analysis
```

2. Verify "Export to Sheets" button is visible:
   - Button located in dashboard header or actions panel
   - Button text: "Export to Sheets" or "üìä Export to Google Sheets"
   - Button enabled (not disabled/greyed out)

3. Click "Export to Sheets" button

4. Verify export process initiated:
   - Loading spinner or progress indicator appears
   - Button becomes disabled during export
   - User sees "Exporting..." or similar status message

**Expected Results**:
- ‚úÖ Export button visible and clickable
- ‚úÖ Loading state displayed during export
- ‚úÖ API request sent to export endpoint
- ‚úÖ User receives feedback on export progress

**Pass Criteria**:
- [ ] Export button renders correctly
- [ ] Click triggers export API call
- [ ] Loading state displayed
- [ ] Button disabled during export

### Test Case 1.2: Export API Endpoint

**Test Steps**:
1. Trigger export via API:
```bash
curl -X POST http://localhost:8081/api/v1/workflows/19952bd09cfe44bc9460c4f521caca89/gap-analysis/export-to-sheets -H "Content-Type: application/json"

### Test Case 1.3: Export Error Handling

**Test Steps**:
1. Test export with missing gap analysis data:
```bash
curl -X POST http://localhost:8081/api/v1/workflows/{invalid_workflow_id}/gap-analysis/export-to-sheets -H "Content-Type: application/json"

--
(.venv) yitzchak@MacBookPro presgen-assess % curl -X POST http://localhost:8081/api/v1/workflows/{invalid_workflow_id}/gap-analysis/export-to-sheets -H "Content-Type: application/json"
{"detail":[{"type":"uuid_parsing","loc":["path","workflow_id"],"msg":"Input should be a valid UUID, invalid character: expected an optional prefix of `urn:uuid:` followed by [0-9a-fA-F-], found `i` at 1","input":"invalid_workflow_id","ctx":{"error":"invalid character: expected an optional prefix of `urn:uuid:` followed by [0-9a-fA-F-], found `i` at 1"},"url":"https://errors.pydantic.dev/2.11/v/uuid_parsing"}]}%         
```

**Expected Response**:
```json
{
  "success": false,
  "error": "Gap analysis not found for workflow",
  "status_code": 404

## üìù Notes and Issues

_Document any issues, blockers, or observations during testing:_

## üîß Database Schema Requirements

Sprint 2 requires the following table for export tracking:

```sql
-- Google Sheets Export Tracking
CREATE TABLE IF NOT EXISTS google_sheets_exports (
    id UUID PRIMARY KEY DEFAULT gen_random_uuid(),
    workflow_id UUID NOT NULL REFERENCES workflow_executions(id) ON DELETE CASCADE,
    sheet_id VARCHAR(255) NOT NULL,
    sheet_url TEXT NOT NULL,
    tabs JSONB NOT NULL DEFAULT '[]'::jsonb,
    exported_at TIMESTAMP DEFAULT NOW(),
    export_duration_ms INTEGER,
    export_status VARCHAR(50) DEFAULT 'completed',
    error_message TEXT,
    created_at TIMESTAMP DEFAULT NOW()
);

CREATE INDEX idx_sheets_workflow ON google_sheets_exports(workflow_id);
CREATE INDEX idx_sheets_status ON google_sheets_exports(export_status);
```
