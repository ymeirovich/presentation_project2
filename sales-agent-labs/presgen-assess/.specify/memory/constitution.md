# PresGen-Assess Constitution

## Core Principles

### Learning-First Design
All features MUST be grounded in established learning science principles with pedagogical soundness as the foundation. The system MUST provide multi-dimensional gap analysis addressing knowledge, skills, motivation, environment, and organizational factors. Adaptive personalization MUST tailor content and pacing to individual learning needs and backgrounds. Focus MUST be on mastery-based progression rather than time-based completion.

### Assessment Integrity
Assessments MUST accurately measure intended competencies with psychometric validity and >85% correlation with expert review. The system MUST eliminate bias and ensure equal opportunity for all learners through regular accessibility audits. All scenarios MUST use real-world contexts that mirror actual job performance. Gap identification methodology MUST be transparent with clear explanation of how gaps are identified and addressed.

### RAG-Enhanced Content Quality
All generated content MUST reflect current best practices and service specifications through RAG knowledge base validation with >85% relevance for assessment generation. The system MUST maintain currency through regular updates matching evolving certification requirements. High-stakes assessments and complex concepts MUST undergo human expert validation. Multiple learning modalities (text, visual, avatar narration) MUST accommodate different learning styles.

### Ethical AI Use
AI MUST enhance rather than replace human judgment in learning decisions with human-centered automation. Users MUST understand how AI generates assessments and identifies gaps through transparent methodology. Data collection MUST be minimal with clear consent and secure handling following privacy-by-design principles. The system MUST conduct regular audits to identify and correct discriminatory patterns.

### Integration Excellence
The system MUST follow established PresGen patterns and conventions for architectural consistency. User experience MUST be unified across Core, Data, Video, and Assess modules with seamless interface integration. Performance MUST maintain the high standards of existing PresGen infrastructure with reliable service delivery. Architecture MUST support growth without compromising quality through scalable design principles.

## Quality Gates

### Before Any Feature Release
- Pedagogical review by instructional design expert MUST be completed
- Technical accuracy validation by subject matter expert MUST be completed
- Bias and accessibility audit MUST be completed with WCAG 2.1 AA compliance
- Integration testing with existing PresGen modules MUST pass
- Performance benchmarks MUST be met per defined standards
- Legal compliance verification MUST be completed including privacy requirements

### Before Production Deployment
- User acceptance testing with target learners MUST be completed
- Load testing under expected usage patterns MUST pass with >99% uptime
- Security vulnerability assessment MUST be completed
- Data privacy impact assessment MUST be completed with GDPR/CCPA compliance
- Expert review of high-stakes assessment content MUST be completed
- Documentation MUST be complete and accessible

## Performance Standards

### Workflow Performance Requirements
Assessment generation MUST complete within 3 minutes including RAG retrieval. Gap analysis processing MUST complete within 1 minute with >85% accuracy correlation. Training plan generation MUST complete within 30 seconds. Course outline generation MUST complete within 2 minutes per course. Complete 11-step workflow MUST complete within 30 minutes for 5 courses.

### RAG System Performance Requirements
Document ingestion MUST complete within 1 minute per 100 pages. Context retrieval MUST complete within 500ms for 5 relevant chunks. Knowledge base updates MUST complete within 5 minutes for certification profile. Vector search accuracy MUST achieve >85% relevance for assessment generation.

## Governance

This constitution supersedes all other development practices. All pull requests and code reviews MUST verify compliance with these principles. Any deviation from constitutional principles MUST be explicitly justified with documented rationale and expert approval. Complexity additions MUST demonstrate clear learning effectiveness or technical benefits.

Amendment procedures require documentation of impact, stakeholder approval including instructional design experts, and migration plan for existing features. Quality gates may be updated through standard review process with performance validation. Constitutional principles require unanimous agreement for changes.

Compliance review processes include constitutional compliance verification before merge, continuous learning effectiveness monitoring, technical performance validation against defined standards, and integration quality verification through automated and manual testing.
