# PresGen-Assess Phase 2 Progress

## üìã Phase 2 Overview
**Duration**: Days 8-14 (7 days)
**Focus**: Assessment Engine & LLM Integration
**Start Date**: September 23, 2025

## üéØ Phase 2 Goals
1. **LLM Integration**: OpenAI service for intelligent assessment generation
2. **Assessment Engine**: RAG-enhanced question generation with domain targeting
3. **Gap Analysis**: Confidence scoring and personalized learning path generation
4. **Presentation Service**: PresGen-Core integration for 40-slide presentations
5. **Testing Suite**: Comprehensive validation and performance testing

## üèóÔ∏è Architecture Components Being Built

### LLM Service Layer (`src/services/llm_service.py`)
- **Purpose**: OpenAI integration for intelligent content generation
- **Features**: Async operations, prompt engineering, cost tracking
- **Integration**: RAG context enhancement, citation handling

### Assessment Engine (`src/services/assessment_engine.py`)
- **Purpose**: Generate domain-targeted assessment questions
- **Features**: Bloom's taxonomy, difficulty calibration, multiple question types
- **Integration**: Knowledge base context, certification profiles

### Gap Analysis Engine (`src/services/gap_analysis.py`)
- **Purpose**: Analyze learning gaps and confidence patterns
- **Features**: Confidence scoring, remediation planning, progress tracking
- **Integration**: Assessment results, personalized learning paths

### Presentation Service (`src/services/presentation_service.py`)
- **Purpose**: Generate 40-slide presentations via PresGen-Core
- **Features**: Content adaptation, async generation, progress tracking
- **Integration**: Assessment results, gap analysis, RAG context

## üéØ Success Criteria for Phase 2

### Functional Requirements
- [ ] Generate assessment questions using LLM with RAG context
- [ ] Analyze learning gaps with confidence scoring
- [ ] Generate 40-slide presentations based on assessment results
- [ ] Maintain source attribution and citations throughout
- [ ] Support async workflows with progress tracking

### Technical Requirements
- [ ] All services use async/await patterns
- [ ] Comprehensive error handling and logging
- [ ] Unit test coverage > 80%
- [ ] Integration tests for all major workflows
- [ ] Performance: Handle 10+ concurrent users

### Quality Requirements
- [ ] Generated questions are contextually relevant
- [ ] Gap analysis provides actionable insights
- [ ] Presentations include proper source citations
- [ ] API responses under 2 seconds for simple operations
- [ ] Async operations provide progress updates

## üöÄ Next Steps
1. Implement LLM service integration with OpenAI
2. Build assessment generation engine with RAG enhancement
3. Create gap analysis with confidence scoring
4. Integrate with PresGen-Core for presentation generation
5. Add comprehensive testing and validation

## üìù Implementation Notes
- All new services should follow async patterns established in Phase 1
- RAG context integration is critical for all LLM operations
- Maintain 40-slide validation throughout presentation generation
- Source attribution must be preserved in all generated content
- Error handling should support graceful degradation
