# Implementation Plan

## Phase 0 – Environment & Guardrails (Week 0)
- Finalize repository skeleton, environment configuration, and CI smoke jobs so Python/Node services boot cleanly with lint/test placeholders (see `README.md:75`, `README.md:112`).
- Stand up governance playbooks for pedagogy, ethical AI, and quality gates mandated by the product constitution (`presgen_assessment_prd.md:12`).
- Define cross-team RACI, delivery cadence, and risk log covering RAG accuracy, Google API quotas, and privacy exposure (`presgen_assessment_prd.md:96`).

## Phase 1 – Knowledge Base & Data Layer (Weeks 1-3)
- Implement document ingestion, chunking, and vector storage (PDF/DOCX/TXT) using ChromaDB plus metadata persistence in Postgres (`specification.md:18`, `presgen_assessment_prd.md:76`).
- Build certification profile CRUD, versioning, and domain modeling APIs with schema migrations and fixtures (`specification.md:31`, `presgen_assessment_prd.md:108`).
- Deliver unit and contract tests for ingestion pipelines, vector retrieval latency, and profile validations to hit <500 ms search and <1 minute/100 pages ingestion KPIs (`presgen_assessment_prd.md:95`).

## Phase 2 – Assessment & Gap Engines (Weeks 4-7)
- Develop assessment generator service covering RAG context retrieval, Bloom-tiered question synthesis, distractor creation, and educational QA hooks (`architecture.md:55`, `presgen_assessment_prd.md:134`).
- Implement gap analysis engine spanning knowledge, skills, application, confidence, and depth metrics, exporting structured sheets and remediation payloads (`architecture.md:151`, `presgen_assessment_prd.md:166`).
- Create FastAPI endpoints, Pydantic models, and async tasks for assessment lifecycle with contract/integration tests covering success, edge, and error flows (`README.md:157`, `specification.md:53`).

## Phase 3 – Workflow Orchestration & Integrations (Weeks 8-10)
- Build state machine orchestrator with step registry, retries, timeout policies, and audit logging for the 11-step pipeline (`README.md:141`, `specification.md:63`).
- Ship Google Forms/Sheets/Drive clients plus PresGen-Core and PresGen-Avatar adapters, including rate-limit handling and structured logging (`README.md:49`, `specification.md:24`).
- Provide monitoring dashboards and alerting on workflow SLA breaches, API quotas, and content-generation failures (`architecture.md:217`).

## Phase 4 – Experience, Hardening & Launch (Weeks 11-12)
- Deliver minimal Next.js dashboard for workflow status, gap reports, and generated assets, aligned with API gateway contracts (`architecture.md:23`).
- Complete performance, security, bias, and accessibility validations aligned with quality gates; address findings before release (`presgen_assessment_prd.md:19`).
- Finalize documentation, run pilot workflows, collect SME sign-off, and prepare Docker/container deployment artifacts (`README.md:105`, `architecture.md:266`).

## Parallel & Ongoing Streams
- Maintain unit, integration, contract, performance, and security test suites per module with continuous coverage tracking (`README.md:62`, `presgen_assessment_prd.md:189`).
- Enhance observability, telemetry, and feedback loops; groom backlog for roadmap Phase 2+ features (`README.md:171`, `presgen_assessment_prd.md:221`).
