# Quickstart: Read Specification Document

## Overview
This quickstart guide validates the document reading functionality for the PresGen-Assess platform. It covers the basic usage scenarios and validates that users can successfully access specification documents.

## Prerequisites
- PresGen-Assess development environment running
- API server accessible at `http://localhost:8080`
- `specification.md` file exists in the project root
- `curl` or similar HTTP client available

## Test Scenarios

### Scenario 1: Read Specification Document (Success Case)

**Objective**: Verify that users can successfully read the main specification document.

**Steps**:
1. Make a GET request to read the specification
2. Verify successful response with content
3. Validate response format and metadata

**Commands**:
```bash
# Read specification document as JSON
curl -X GET "http://localhost:8080/documents/specification" \
  -H "Accept: application/json" \
  -v

# Expected Response (200 OK):
{
  "status": "success",
  "timestamp": "2025-09-22T10:30:00Z",
  "content": "# PresGen-Assess Technical Specification\n\n## System Overview...",
  "metadata": {
    "name": "specification.md",
    "type": "specification",
    "size_bytes": 51200,
    "last_modified": "2025-09-22T09:15:00Z"
  }
}
```

**Validation**:
- [ ] Response status code is 200
- [ ] Response contains `status: "success"`
- [ ] Response contains document content
- [ ] Response contains metadata with file information
- [ ] Content is properly formatted markdown

### Scenario 2: Read Specification as Markdown (Direct Access)

**Objective**: Verify that users can access the specification document in raw markdown format.

**Steps**:
1. Request specification with markdown content type
2. Verify content is returned as plain markdown
3. Validate content preservation

**Commands**:
```bash
# Read specification as raw markdown
curl -X GET "http://localhost:8080/documents/specification" \
  -H "Accept: text/markdown" \
  -v

# Expected Response (200 OK):
# Content-Type: text/markdown; charset=utf-8
# Content-Disposition: inline; filename=specification.md

# PresGen-Assess Technical Specification

### Scenario 3: Get Document Metadata Only

**Objective**: Verify that users can retrieve document metadata without downloading content.

**Steps**:
1. Request document metadata endpoint
2. Verify metadata response structure
3. Validate file information accuracy

**Commands**:
```bash
# Get document metadata
curl -X GET "http://localhost:8080/documents/specification.md/metadata" \
  -H "Accept: application/json" \
  -v

# Expected Response (200 OK):
{
  "name": "specification.md",
  "type": "specification",
  "size_bytes": 51200,
  "last_modified": "2025-09-22T09:15:00Z",
  "checksum": "a1b2c3d4e5f6"
}
```

**Validation**:
- [ ] Response status code is 200
- [ ] Response contains document name
- [ ] Response contains document type
- [ ] Response contains accurate file size
- [ ] Response contains last modified timestamp
- [ ] No document content is included

### Scenario 4: List Available Documents

**Objective**: Verify that users can discover available documents.

**Steps**:
1. Request list of available documents
2. Verify response format
3. Validate document list contents

**Commands**:
```bash
# List all available documents
curl -X GET "http://localhost:8080/documents" \
  -H "Accept: application/json" \
  -v

# Expected Response (200 OK):
{
  "documents": [
    {
      "name": "specification.md",
      "type": "specification",
      "size_bytes": 51200,
      "last_modified": "2025-09-22T09:15:00Z"
    },
    {
      "name": "architecture.md",
      "type": "architecture",
      "size_bytes": 73400,
      "last_modified": "2025-09-22T08:30:00Z"
    }
  ],
  "count": 2
}
```

**Validation**:
- [ ] Response status code is 200
- [ ] Response contains documents array
- [ ] Response contains accurate count
- [ ] Each document has required metadata fields
- [ ] Documents include specification.md

### Scenario 5: Handle Document Not Found (Error Case)

**Objective**: Verify proper error handling when requesting non-existent documents.

**Steps**:
1. Request a non-existent document
2. Verify proper error response
3. Validate error message structure

**Commands**:
```bash
# Request non-existent document
curl -X GET "http://localhost:8080/documents/nonexistent.md" \
  -H "Accept: application/json" \
  -v

# Expected Response (404 Not Found):
{
  "status": "not_found",
  "timestamp": "2025-09-22T10:30:00Z",
  "error": {

**Commands**:
```bash
# Request document with invalid name (path traversal attempt)
curl -X GET "http://localhost:8080/documents/../etc/passwd" \
  -H "Accept: application/json" \
  -v
