# Feature Specification: Read Specification Document

**Feature Branch**: `001-read-specification-md`
**Created**: 2025-09-22
**Status**: Draft
**Input**: User description: "read specification.md"

## Execution Flow (main)
```
1. Parse user description from Input
   ’ Feature: Read and process existing specification.md document
2. Extract key concepts from description
   ’ Actors: Users, system administrators, developers
   ’ Actions: Read, parse, validate, extract information
   ’ Data: Specification document content, metadata
   ’ Constraints: Document format, access permissions
3. For each unclear aspect:
   ’ [NEEDS CLARIFICATION: specific output format for read results]
   ’ [NEEDS CLARIFICATION: who has permission to read specifications]
4. Fill User Scenarios & Testing section
   ’ Primary flow: User requests to read specification document
5. Generate Functional Requirements
   ’ Document reading, content parsing, error handling
6. Identify Key Entities
   ’ Specification document, user sessions, content metadata
7. Run Review Checklist
   ’ WARN "Spec has uncertainties regarding output format and permissions"
8. Return: SUCCESS (spec ready for planning)
```

## User Scenarios & Testing *(mandatory)*

### Primary User Story
As a user, I want to read the specification.md document so that I can understand the system requirements, architecture, and implementation details for the PresGen-Assess platform.

### Acceptance Scenarios
1. **Given** a valid specification.md file exists, **When** user requests to read it, **Then** the system displays the complete document content in a readable format
2. **Given** user has appropriate access permissions, **When** they request the specification, **Then** the system provides the full content without errors
3. **Given** the specification document contains technical details, **When** user reads it, **Then** all sections including architecture, workflows, and data models are clearly presented

### Edge Cases
- What happens when specification.md file doesn't exist or is corrupted?
- How does system handle large specification documents that exceed display limits?
- What occurs when user lacks permissions to access the specification file?

## Requirements *(mandatory)*

### Functional Requirements
- **FR-001**: System MUST locate and access the specification.md file from the project root directory
- **FR-002**: System MUST read the complete content of the specification document
- **FR-003**: System MUST present the specification content in a readable format
- **FR-004**: System MUST handle file access errors gracefully with appropriate error messages
- **FR-005**: System MUST validate that the document exists before attempting to read
- **FR-006**: Users MUST be able to access specification content [NEEDS CLARIFICATION: permission model not specified]
- **FR-007**: System MUST preserve document formatting during reading [NEEDS CLARIFICATION: output format requirements not specified]

### Key Entities *(include if feature involves data)*
- **Specification Document**: Contains system requirements, architecture details, workflow descriptions, and technical specifications for PresGen-Assess
- **User Session**: Represents active user requesting document access with associated permissions
- **Document Metadata**: File information including size, modification date, and access permissions
