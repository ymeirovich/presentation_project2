### âœ… **Phase 5: Real Voice Cloning Implementation (September 16, 2025)**
**Status:** COMPLETED
**Completion:** 100%

**Objective:** Replace placeholder voice cloning with production-ready TTS integration

**Completed Deliverables:**
- âœ… **ElevenLabs Integration**: Real voice cloning API implementation with custom voice creation
- âœ… **OpenAI TTS Integration**: Fallback TTS system with high-quality voice synthesis
- âœ… **Audio Processing Pipeline**: FFmpeg-based audio extraction and validation for voice cloning
- âœ… **Voice Profile Management**: Enhanced persistence with engine-specific model storage
- âœ… **LivePortrait Optimization**: Single-face avatar output with improved parameters
- âœ… **Avatar Post-Processing**: Automatic video cropping and optimization for avatar display

**Technical Implementation:**
- **Voice Cloning Engines**: ElevenLabs (primary) â†’ OpenAI TTS (fallback) â†’ System TTS (last resort)
- **Audio Validation**: 10-300 second duration requirements with quality checks
- **LivePortrait Configuration**: 512px standardized output, face cropping enabled, smooth animation
- **Dependencies Added**: `elevenlabs>=1.0.0`, `openai>=1.0.0`, `pydub>=0.25.0`

**Final Implementation Status:**
- âœ… **All LivePortrait Timeout Issues Resolved**: Fixed function naming and reduced timeouts to 10-20 minutes

- âœ… **Integration Testing Complete**: Full pipeline tested and functional

### ðŸ”§ **Post-Production Hotfix (September 15, 2025)**
**Issue:** Voice profile references to audio files were broken, preventing voice cloning functionality
**Root Cause:** Audio files were being temporarily extracted but not permanently stored for reuse

**Solution Implemented:**
- âœ… **Permanent Audio Storage**: All `.wav` files now saved in `presgen-training2/temp/` permanently
- âœ… **Hash-based Filenames**: Consistent naming based on source video content enables file reuse
- âœ… **API Endpoint Fix**: `/training/clone-voice` now properly handles file uploads with `UploadFile`
- âœ… **Parameter Support**: Added language parameter support throughout the pipeline
- âœ… **CORS Update**: Added `http://localhost:3001` to allowed origins for frontend integration

**Technical Details:**
- Modified `VoiceManager._extract_enhanced_audio()` for permanent storage with reuse logic
- Updated FastAPI endpoint to accept file uploads instead of file paths
- Fixed parameter passing in `ModeOrchestrator.clone_voice_from_video()`
- Comprehensive end-to-end testing validated complete workflow

**Result:** Voice cloning now fully functional with permanent audio file storage and seamless file upload workflow.
