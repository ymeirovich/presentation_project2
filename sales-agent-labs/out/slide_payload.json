  "script": "Acme FinTech's data engineering team struggles with schema drift in their 80+ ETL pipelines, costing 6-10 engineer-hours weekly.  The CFO demands a 25% infrastructure cost reduction.  A managed ETL solution offers a potential solution, with pilot programs showing 30% infra savings and 60% faster schema changes.  However, SOC2 compliance and an upcoming security audit necessitate careful consideration of solution compatibility and auditability. We need a solution that minimizes replatforming while adding governance and audit trails.",
