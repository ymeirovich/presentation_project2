# PRD — PresGen-Video (MVP, Local-First)

## 1) Project Overview & Goals

**Goal:** Add a new **Video → Timed Slides** workflow to PresGen that takes a 1–3 minute recorded video, extracts a transcript, summarizes key points, and outputs a single composed video where the **left 50%** shows the cropped speaker and the **right 50%** shows slide PNGs that change at the appropriate timestamps. The MVP must prioritize **speed to demo**, **low cost**, and **local processing**. Any GCP artifacts used (if toggled on) must be **ephemeral** and auto-deleted; the final composed video must be downloadable. &#x20;

**Context fit:** PresGen already has an MCP-orchestrated backend with summarization tools and a modern Next.js UI with a placeholder “Video” tab—this feature fills that gap as a third workflow alongside Core and Data. &#x20;

**Non-goals (MVP):** Large-scale batch, multi-hour videos, brand templates, advanced motion graphics, speaker diarization.

## 2) Target Audience & User Personas

1. **AE / Sales Engineer (External Demo Persona)**
   Wants to quickly convert a short call or pitch clip into a video with on-screen highlights for internal sharing or customer follow-up.

2. **Founder / PM (VC Demo Persona)**
   Needs a compelling, low-latency demo that shows PresGen converting raw media into clear, structured outputs with minimal cloud dependencies and cost.

3. **Enablement Ops (Pilot Persona)**
   Validates workflow feasibility; cares that the overlay points are accurate and the result is shareable via download link.

## 3) Core Features & Functionality

### 3.1 UI (Next.js)

* **New “Video” tab** next to Core/Data; form fields:

  * File upload (MP4/MOV), target length 1–3 minutes.
  * Language selector for transcription.
  * “Number of key points” slider (e.g., 3–10).
  * Cropping mode: **Auto-detect face** (default) or Manual crop (x,y,w,h).
  * **Preview & Edit** flow: after transcription/summarization, show bullets with timestamps; user can edit text and timing before render.
  * **Generate** → returns a **download link** to the composed video.
    (Built with existing component patterns: react-hook-form, zod, FileDrop, toasts.)&#x20;

### 3.2 Processing Pipeline (Local-First)

1. **Audio extraction**: `ffmpeg` extracts audio from the uploaded video.
2. **Transcription (local)**: Whisper/Vosk (CPU or GPU) creates a transcript with timecodes; chunk into 30–60s segments.
3. **Summarization to bullets**: Use existing summarization tool contract (local LLM or Vertex optional). Keep only succinct bullet points; attach each to its segment’s time window.&#x20;
4. **Slide generation (local PNGs)**: Render simple, clean slides (title + bullets only) using HTML/CSS → PNG (Puppeteer) or python-pptx + rasterize; ensure 16:9 and visual consistency with the UI style.
5. **Face detection & crop (local)**: OpenCV/Dlib to find face; compute stable crop; scale to fill **left 50%** of final canvas.
6. **50/50 layout & transitions**: Compose with `ffmpeg`—left: cropped speaker; right: slide PNG. Slides appear per timecodes (`overlay` with `enable='between(t, start, end)'`); add simple fade between slides.
7. **Output**: MP4 (H.264/AAC). Persist file to a local job folder; expose **download** route.
8. **Cleanup**: Auto-delete intermediate files on job completion + scheduled TTL cleanup for final outputs (e.g., 24h).

> **Alternatives & Enhancements (implemented in MVP):**
> • **Preview & edit bullets** before final render.
> • **Manual crop override** (drag handles or numeric inputs).
> • **Direct local slide rendering** (avoid Slides API) for speed/cost; later opt-in to Google Slides for richer themes.
> • **Optional cloud toggles** for summarization/storage (off by default).

### 3.3 Backend APIs (FastAPI)

* `POST /video/upload` → store file in `/tmp/jobs/{job_id}/raw.mp4`, return `job_id`.
* `POST /video/preview/{job_id}` → run transcription + summarization; return bullets with time ranges.
* `POST /video/generate/{job_id}` → accept edited bullets; run face-crop + composition; return `download_url`.
* `GET /video/result/{job_id}` → stream/download final MP4 and schedule TTL delete.
  Uses existing service patterns, idempotency, logging conventions and timeouts from the codebase.&#x20;

## 4) Technical Requirements & Constraints

### 4.1 Local-First Stack

* **Mandatory tools:** ffmpeg, Python 3.11+, OpenCV/Dlib, Whisper/Vosk; Node + Puppeteer (if HTML-to-PNG).
* **Optional cloud:** Vertex AI (Gemini) for summarization; Google Slides/Drive if toggled on for slide creation/storage. Keep **off** by default to minimize cost.&#x20;

### 4.2 Performance Assumptions

* Inputs are 1–3 minutes → pipeline can run synchronously on a single server/VM.
* Target end-to-end (upload → download link) within a few minutes on CPU; faster with GPU for Whisper.

### 4.3 File/Resource Limits

* Max upload: 200 MB; accepted: mp4, mov.
* Per-job workspace in `/tmp/jobs/{job_id}`; delete intermediates immediately after composition and final MP4 after TTL unless user opted to keep.

### 4.4 Frontend Integration & Deployment

* Extend current UI and API client (`lib/api.ts`) to support new endpoints; keep ngrok header behavior for dev.&#x20;
* Frontend env uses the same `NEXT_PUBLIC_API_BASE_URL` pattern documented in deployment guide.&#x20;

### 4.5 Security & Privacy

* Validate content type/size; sanitize user-edited bullets; never log raw media.
* **If GCP toggled on:** enable only required APIs/roles; store temporary artifacts in GCS with short lifecycle rules; delete on success/failure.&#x20;

### 4.6 Testing & Tooling

* Reuse existing dev workflow (uvicorn server, smoke tests); add new integration checks for `/video/*` endpoints and timing expectations. &#x20;
* Keep observability minimal (JSON logs, request IDs) as in current system.&#x20;

### 4.7 GCP Provisioning for Testing — **Direct Answer**

* **Not required** for the MVP demo if you run transcription, summarization, slide rendering, and composition locally.
* If you **opt-in** to Vertex AI summarization or Slides/Drive export, confirm those APIs and minimal roles are enabled on the existing project/service account (no new infra needed for testing).&#x20;
